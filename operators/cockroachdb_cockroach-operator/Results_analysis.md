## 1)TestCases (3/32)

| Test Case Identifier                           | Affected Field | Test Case Description | isBug |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-01-0001/0001`  | `grpcPort`     | Integer change        | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-06-0006/0001`  | `httpPort`     | Integer change        | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-11-0001/0001`  | `sqlPort`      | Integer change        | TRUE  |


## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
Acto triggered alarms for three distinct test cases involving changes to the integer values of essential port configurations (`grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort`). Each modification threatened the system's communication infrastructure and, by extension, its operational integrity. 
These changes let to the pods to crash.




**What happened in the state transition?**  
The alteration in integer values for these ports led to configurations that were either invalid or caused resource conflicts. This, in turn, prevented the server from initiating correctly, affecting its ability to handle gRPC, HTTP, and SQL communications effectively.
Pods crashed as they did not have permission to connect to these ports and the Service failed to init leading to the crash.

**Why Actoâ€™s oracles raised an alarm?**  
The oracles identified the changes as significant threats to the node's functionality. Given that these ports are foundational for the operation of the system, any misconfiguration could result in severe operational failures, justifying the alarms.

## Root Cause

**Why did the operator behave in this way?**  
The root cause of the issue is the operator's failure to validate and sanitize the input values for the `grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort` configurations. When changes were applied to these fields, the operator did not verify the new port values' availability or appropriateness, leading to problematic configurations being set.

Pods crashed as they did not have permission to connect to these ports and the Service failed to init leading to the crash. Failure to check for the port correctness on the oparator's side lead to this issue, as they are expected to reject incorrect ports.

**Exact block in the operator source code:**  
The issue originates from the `cockroach-operator/pkg/resource/discovery_service.go` file, within the build function responsible for configuring service specifications:
```go
service.Spec = corev1.ServiceSpec{
    ClusterIP: "None",
    PublishNotReadyAddresses: true,
    Ports: []corev1.ServicePort{
        {Name: "grpc", Port: *b.Cluster.Spec().GRPCPort},
        {Name: "http", Port: *b.Cluster.Spec().HTTPPort},
        {Name: "sql", Port: *b.Cluster.Spec().SQLPort}
    }
}
```
This snippet demonstrates the direct assignment of port values from the cluster specification to the service ports without conducting necessary pre-assignment checks for port validity and availability.

## Expected behavior?

This is a **TRUE** Alarm as the Pods actually crashed during the runs.

**Fix in the operator code:**  
To resolve this issue, the operator code must be updated to incorporate a validation step prior to applying changes to the `grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort` configurations. The validation should ensure that:

- **Port Availability:** The new port values do not conflict with already allocated resources or reserved system ports. This could entail querying Kubernetes or the underlying system to check port availability.

- **Port Validity:** The port values are within a permissible range and not commonly used by other critical services or protocols, minimizing the risk of conflicts.

- **Error Handling:** In case the validation fails, the operator should either keep the previous functional configuration or apply a default, known-good port value. It should also provide clear and actionable error messages that describe the reason for the failure and suggest possible fixes.

The implementation of these changes would enhance the build function with a robust mechanism for port validation, potentially involving additional utility functions or external API interactions to ascertain the status of the specified ports. By ensuring the new port values are validated for both availability and suitability, the operator can prevent configuration-related errors, thereby improving the system's stability and reliability.

## 2)TestCases (6/32)

| Test Case Identifier                           | Affected Field | Misclassification      | isBug |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-01-0000/0009`  | `grpcPort`     | Integer deletion       | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-06-0005/0001`  | `httpPort`     | Integer deletion       | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-11-0000/0009`  | `sqlPort`      | Integer deletion       | TRUE  |

## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
Acto raised alarms for three test cases, each classified as an integer deletion for essential port configurations (`grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort`). However, upon inspection, it was determined that these alarms were misclassified. The actual mutation in these cases involved adding port values rather than deleting them. Despite the misclassification, the alarms were justified based on the reasons outlined in previous test cases involving integer changes.

**Misclassification Issue:**  
The test cases were incorrectly classified as integer deletions in the mutated YAML files, whereas the changes were similar to the previously discussed integer changes, indicating an addition of port values.

**Justification for Raising the Alarm:**  
Although misclassified, the rationale for raising the alarm remains valid as per the analysis provided in the earlier cases. The changes to port configurations, even if added and not deleted, could lead to system crashes due to improper validation and sanitization of port values.

## Root Cause

**Misclassification Analysis:**  
The primary issue here is not with the operator's behavior but with the classification mechanism used by Acto. The system erroneously identified changes in port configurations as deletions.

**Impact of Misclassification:**  
This misclassification could potentially lead to confusion in troubleshooting and addressing the root cause of the alarms. However, the underlying issue remains the same: the failure to validate and sanitize input values for the `grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort` configurations correctly.

## Expected behavior?

**Alarm Classification Correction:**  
Although the alarms were triggered for a valid reason, it is crucial to correct the classification mechanism within Acto to accurately reflect the nature of the mutations. This ensures clarity in understanding the alarms and aids in the precise diagnosis of issues.

**Reaffirmation of the Fix in Operator Code:**  
As previously recommended, the operator code must be updated to incorporate a validation step prior to applying changes to the `grpcPort`, `httpPort`, and `sqlPort` configurations. This includes checks for:

- **Port Availability:** Ensuring new port values do not conflict with allocated resources or system ports.
- **Port Validity:** Verifying the port values are within acceptable ranges and not used by other services.
- **Error Handling:** Applying a default port value or retaining the previous configuration if validation fails, accompanied by clear, actionable error messages.

**Conclusion:**  
This report reaffirms the necessity for the recommended fixes in the operator code to address the root cause of the alarms. Simultaneously, it highlights the need for Acto to improve its classification mechanism to prevent future instances of misclassification, thereby enhancing the system's stability and reliability.

## 3)TestCases (12/32)

| Test Case Identifier                          | Description   | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-04-0000/0000` | No mutation   | FALSE |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-06-0000/0000` | No mutation   | FALSE |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0004/0000` | No mutation   | FALSE |

| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-10-0000/0000` | No mutation   | FALSE |


## What happened

**Why were these alarms wrongly classified?**  
Acto flagged these test cases as alarms without any actual configuration changes being applied. The mutations expected or indicated did not occur, and when the YAML files generated during these test cases were deployed in a sandboxed environment, they performed correctly, demonstrating that the system's deployment capabilities were intact.

**Observations from Acto's Reports:**  
Acto attributed the alarms to operational issues, as evidenced by the restart counts of the `cockroach-operator-manager` pods. However, these restarts could be attributed to factors unrelated to the current test cases, such as residuals from previous tests, configuration issues, or improper termination handling of previous test cases.

## Analysis

**Operational Issue Indication:**  
The restart counts suggest intermittent operational issues within Acto or the deployment system itself rather than problems with the test cases or the YAML configurations. This misclassification of alarms points to the necessity for a more refined diagnostic approach within Acto to differentiate between actual configuration issues and operational anomalies.

**Potential Causes for Misclassification:**  
- Residual effects from previous test runs that weren't adequately cleared or reset.
- Configuration issues within the Acto environment that led to false positives.
- Inadequate termination handling for test cases, causing overlapping or residual impacts on subsequent tests.

## Expected behavior?

**Improvements in Acto's Diagnostic Mechanism:**  
To prevent such misclassifications, Acto needs to enhance its diagnostic and monitoring mechanisms. This includes:

- **Clearing Residual States:** Ensuring that the environment is returned to a clean state after each test run to prevent carry-over effects.
- **Refined Monitoring:** Implementing more granular monitoring to accurately identify the root cause of restarts and differentiate between operational issues and actual configuration problems.
- **Enhanced Termination Handling:** Developing robust termination processes for test cases to ensure all components are correctly shutdown and reset before the next test begins.

**Conclusion:**  
While the alarms were triggered due to perceived operational issues, the analysis indicates that these were false alarms resulting from misclassifications by Acto. Corrective measures focusing on improving Acto's diagnostic capabilities and operational handling are recommended to mitigate such occurrences in the future, ensuring that alarms accurately reflect the state of the system and its configurations.

## 4)TestCases (15/32)

| Test Case Identifier                          | Affected Field      | Test Case Description | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0001/0001` | `additionalArgs`    | Array deletion        | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0002/0002` | `additionalArgs`    | Array push            | TRUE  |

## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
Acto raised alarms for modifications to the `additionalArgs` field within the pod specifications, which were directly passed to the CockroachDB startup script without verification of their correctness. The addition of `ACTOKEY` as an `additionalArg` resulted in the node's crash, as demonstrated by the error message indicating that `ACTOKEY` is an unknown command for `cockroach start`.

**Error Encountered:**  
The error logs revealed a failure in the node startup due to the unrecognized argument `ACTOKEY`, highlighting an issue in the handling of `additionalArgs`:
ERROR: unknown command "ACTOKEY" for "cockroach start"
Failed running "start"

## Root Cause

**Analysis:**  
The root cause of the crash lies in the `cockroach-operator/pkg/resource/statefulset.go:389` file under the `dbArgs()` function, where `additionalArgs` from the pod specifications are appended directly to the database startup arguments without any form of validation or sanitization:

```go
aa = append(aa, b.Spec().AdditionalArgs...)
```
This code block allows for any specified additionalArgs to be included in the command line for the CockroachDB startup script, without checking if these arguments are valid or supported by CockroachDB.

**Consequences:**
By appending additionalArgs directly, there is a significant risk that invalid or incorrect arguments can lead to operational issues, such as the failure to start the database service, as observed.

## Expected behavior?

The operator verifies the args before passing and not crash the system.

**Fix in the Operator Code:**
To prevent such issues, the operator code must be enhanced to include validation and sanitization steps for additionalArgs. This should involve:

- **Validation of Arguments:** Implement a mechanism to validate each entry within additionalArgs against a list of supported or recognized arguments for the CockroachDB start command.
- **Sanitization of Input:** Ensure that arguments passed through additionalArgs do not contain unsupported commands or syntax that could lead to command execution failures.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear and actionable feedback in the event of invalid additionalArgs entries, preventing the application of these arguments and potentially avoiding node startup failures.

**Implementation Suggestion:**
An additional step could be introduced in the dbArgs() function to iterate through AdditionalArgs and check each against a predefined list of acceptable arguments. This step would not only safeguard the startup process from invalid inputs but also enhance the robustness of the deployment strategy, ensuring stability and reliability of the system.

## 5)TestCases (17/32)

| Test Case Identifier                          | Affected Field           | Test Case Description | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0007/0008` | `nodeSelector.ACTOKEY`   | String deletion       | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0008/0001` | `nodeSelector.ACTOKEY`   | String change         | TRUE  |

## What happened

**Configuration Change:**  
Both test cases involved modifications to the `nodeSelector` field, specifically adding `"ACTOKEY: ACTOKEY"` to the pod specifications. This addition was intended to control pod scheduling on nodes labeled with `ACTOKEY=ACTOKEY`.

**Encountered Error:**  
Following the modification, the pods failed to be scheduled, as indicated by the warning from the default scheduler, stating that none of the nodes matched the pod's node affinity/selector criteria. This resulted in all pods remaining unscheduled due to the absence of an appropriate node:
Warning FailedScheduling 20s default-scheduler 0/4 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector. preemption: 0/4 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling, 3 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.

## Root Cause
**Lack of Verification for Node Selector Tags and Labels:**  
The core issue lies in the operator's failure to validate the node selector tags and labels before applying them to the pod specifications. Additionally, once the pods were configured, there was no mechanism in place to verify the effectiveness of the node selectors or to handle the situation where no nodes match the specified criteria.

**Source Code Analysis:**  
The relevant code segment is located in `cockroach-operator/pkg/resource/statefulset.go:236`, within the `makePodTemplate()` function, which applies the `nodeSelector` to the pod specification without any prior validation:

```go
if b.Spec().NodeSelector != nil && len(b.Spec().NodeSelector) > 0 {
	pod.Spec.NodeSelector = b.Spec().NodeSelector
}
```
**Consequences:**
Consequences of Pod Scheduling Failures due to `nodeSelector` Misconfigurations
1. **Service Availability:** Pods remain unscheduled; critical services do not start, directly affecting availability and potentially causing downtime.

2. **Resource Utilization:** Resources allocated for unscheduled pods remain unused, leading to inefficient cluster resource utilization.

3. **System Reliability:** Reliability risks increase with potential cascading failures across dependent services.

4. **Operational Overheads:** Manual troubleshooting and resolution of scheduling issues increase operational burdens.

5. **Data or State Loss:** For stateful applications, scheduling failures could lead to data inconsistency or loss.

6. **Scalability Concerns:** Inability to effectively schedule pods hinders application scalability and performance.

7. **User Experience:** Degrades end-user experience, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction and business loss.


## Expected behavior?

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation:**
- **Objective:** Ensure nodes are available that match `nodeSelector` criteria before deployment.
- **Method:** Query the cluster to verify specified labels exist on at least one node.

2. **Post-Deployment Verification:**
- **Objective:** Confirm pods have been successfully scheduled post-deployment.
- **Method:** If scheduling fails due to node selector issues, trigger an alert or corrective actions.

3. **Fallback Strategy:**
- **Objective:** Address scenarios where no nodes match `nodeSelector` criteria.
- **Method:** Consider removing/adjusting the node selector, using a default node, or manual intervention.

4. **Operator Enhancements:**
- **Objective:** Ensure node selectors are both valid and applicable.
- **Method:** Update operator logic to check for node label existence and `nodeSelector` compatibility.

**Implementation Suggestion:**
Integrating pre-deployment validation and post-deployment verification into the operator's workflow is essential for mitigating pod scheduling failures related to `nodeSelector` configurations. Proactive handling of node selector issues by the operator will bolster pod deployment reliability and adherence to scheduling criteria.

| Test Case Identifier                          | Affected Field           | Test Case Description | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-07-0009/0001` | `nodeSelector.ACTOKEY`   | String-empty          | FALSE |

## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
Acto issued an alarm for a test case involving an empty string assignment to `nodeSelector.ACTOKEY`. This was identified as a false alarm since the operator is designed to ignore `nodeSelector` configurations that are empty or nil, as indicated by the source code.

**Configuration Tested:**  
```yaml
nodeSelector:
  ACTOKEY: ''
```
**Observed Behavior:**
Despite the alarm, the test case should not lead to operational issues based on the code logic, which is intended to exclude empty or nil nodeSelector configurations from affecting pod scheduling.

## Root Cause
**Source Code Analysis:**
The logic in cockroach-operator/pkg/resource/statefulset.go:235 within the makePodTemplate() function confirms that the operator is supposed to ignore empty nodeSelector configurations:
```
if b.Spec().NodeSelector != nil && len(b.Spec().NodeSelector) > 0 {
    pod.Spec.NodeSelector = b.Spec().NodeSelector
}
```

**Reason for False Alarm:**
The alarm was triggered due to a misinterpretation of the operator's behavior, which, as per design, disregards empty nodeSelector configurations and does not impact pod deployment.

## Expected behavior?
The system should not raise an alarm for configurations that are intentionally designed to be ignored by the operator. This scenario underscores the need for:

**Improvement in Alarm Logic:**
Refine Acto's alarm mechanisms to better differentiate between actual configuration errors and situations where the configuration is designed to be ignored, reducing false positives.

**Clarification in Documentation:**
Ensure that the operator's behavior regarding empty or nil configurations is clearly documented, helping to prevent confusion about the expected outcomes of such configurations.

**Enhancement of Validation Logic:**
Although not applicable in this specific case, generally, enhancing the operator's validation logic to provide immediate feedback on unsupported configurations can help preempt potential issues.

## 7)TestCases (20/32)

| Test Case Identifier                          | Affected Field | Test Case Description | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-10-0004/0003` | `spec.cache`   | String deletion       | TRUE  |
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-10-0005/0001` | `spec.cache`   | String change         | TRUE  |

## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
Alarms were raised for the `cache` configuration in the operator specs due to an invalid string input `"ACTOKEY"`. This input deviates from the expected integer (bytes) or percentage of memory format as defined for the `--cache` flag.

**Description of --cache Flag:**  
The `--cache` flag specifies the total size for caches, supporting both size suffixes (e.g., `1GB`) and percentages of physical memory (e.g., `.25`). The default setting is `128MiB` if left unspecified.

**Error Encountered:**  
The operator failed to parse and verify the invalid string `"ACTOKEY"` passed to the `--cache` flag, leading to a configuration error.

## Root Cause

**Analysis:**  
The issue originates from inadequate validation logic in the `cockroach-operator/pkg/resource/statefulset.go:377` within the `dbArgs()` function:

```go
if b.Spec().Cache != "" {
    aa = append(aa, "--cache="+b.Spec().Cache)
} else {
    aa = append(aa, "--cache $(expr $MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB / 4)MiB")
}
```
This code block directly appends the `cache` value from the spec to the startup arguments without validating its format, resulting in operational failures when the input is invalid.

**Consequences:**
Passing an invalid string as the cache size directly affects the pod's startup process, potentially leading to the failure of the CockroachDB instance to start correctly.

## Expected behavior?
The operator should validate cache values against the expected formats before appending them to the database arguments. Specifically, it should check for valid size formats or percentage values and reject unsupported or nonsensical inputs like `"ACTOKEY"`.

**Fix in the Operator Code:**
- **Implement Input Validation:** Introduce a validation step for the `cache` field to ensure inputs adhere to supported formats (either bytes or percentage of memory). If the input is invalid, the operator should log an error or revert to a default value.
- **Provide Feedback on Invalid Configurations:** Enhance error reporting to provide explicit feedback when configuration values are rejected due to validation failures.

**Implementation Suggestion:**
Enhance the `dbArgs()` function with a new validation routine that checks the format of the `cache` value. If the validation fails, the operator could either log a detailed error message explaining the reason or use a safe default value while notifying the user of the adjustment.

| Test Case Identifier                          | Affected Field                                  | Test Case Description | isBug |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `testrun-2024-02-21-22-04/trial-05-0000/0001` | `spec.topologySpreadConstraints[0].topologyKey` | String change         | FALSE |

## What happened

**Why did Acto raise these alarms?**  
An alarm was raised for a change in the `topologyKey` within `topologySpreadConstraints`, suggesting a potential issue. However, sandbox testing did not reproduce the reported problem, indicating the alarm might be a false positive.

**Non-Reproducible Alarm:**  
The alarm's message related to the `cockroach-operator-manager` container's restart count being `[5]` was not observed during sandbox environment testing, suggesting the issue may be specific to the initial testing environment or conditions.

## Root Cause

**Analysis:**  
The alarm seems to have been triggered by an environmental or operational anomaly rather than an actual fault with the `topologySpreadConstraints` configuration. The inability to reproduce the alarm in a controlled sandbox environment suggests the original testing context may contain variables not present or accounted for in the sandbox.

## Expected behavior?

The operator and Acto's monitoring systems should accurately reflect the impact of configuration changes without generating false alarms under normal operational conditions.

## Fix in the Operator Code

- **Refine Alarm Mechanisms:** Enhance Acto's alarm detection logic to better differentiate between actual configuration issues and environmental anomalies.
- **Improve Environmental Consistency:** Ensure testing environments, including sandbox setups, closely mirror production or the original test conditions to accurately capture potential issues.
- **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:** Implement more detailed logging and monitoring around `topologySpreadConstraints` changes to pinpoint the cause of restarts or failures, aiding in distinguishing false alarms from genuine issues.

## Implementation Suggestion

Introduce a mechanism to validate and log changes in `topologySpreadConstraints` configurations, including `topologyKey` modifications, to identify and mitigate potential issues proactively. Further, develop a protocol for analyzing and responding to alarms that considers the possibility of environment-specific anomalies.

## What happened

**Alarm Overview:**  
Alarms were raised across various spec configurations, all indicating issues such as "Found no matching fields for input." However, upon further inspection and testing within a sandbox environment, these alarms proved to be false positives. Changes were effectively applied, and functionalities behaved as expected without the issues indicated by the alarms.

## Analysis of Each Test Case

 `spec.ingress.sql.tls` Array Pop
- **Alarm Message:** No matching fields for input after removing an item from the array.
- **Reality:** Changes were successfully applied, indicating the alarm system might be misinterpreting the array modification as an error.

`spec.topologySpreadConstraints[0].maxSkew` Modifications
- **Alarm Messages:** No matching fields for input upon deletion and changing integer values of `maxSkew`.
- **Reality:** Despite the alarms, modifications to `maxSkew` were valid and did not disrupt system state, suggesting an over-sensitivity of the alarm mechanism to changes in numerical values.

`spec.ingress.sql.annotations` Object Deletion
- **Alarm Message:** No matching fields for input after deletion of an object.
- **Reality:** The deletion took effect as intended, demonstrating the alarm's failure to accurately reflect the operational outcome.

`spec.tolerations` Array Deletion
- **Alarm Message:** No matching fields for input after array deletion.
- **Reality:** The system correctly processed the deletion, contradicting the alarm's indication of an error.

## Expected Behavior

The system should accurately distinguish between legitimate configuration issues and valid state changes or modifications.

## Fix in the Monitoring System

- **Refinement of Detection Logic:** Enhance the criteria and logic used to trigger alarms, focusing on genuine inconsistencies or errors that reflect actual operational issues.
- **Enhanced Validation Checks:** Before raising an alarm, implement additional validation steps to confirm if the perceived issue truly impacts system functionality.
- **Sandbox Testing Integration:** Consider incorporating results from sandbox testing environments into the alarm validation process to reduce false positives based on successful real-world application tests.

## What happened

**Overview:**  
Acto's differential oracle raised alarms for three test cases, each related to a failed attempt at recovering to a seed system state. These alarms suggest that after performing certain operations or tests, the system could not return to its initial, pre-test state, as indicated by system state differences.

**Observation:**  
Despite the alarms, it was noted that the nodes were still in the init phase not completed, particularly highlighted by the log entry for "test-cluster-vcheck-*" being active.

## Analysis

**Differential Oracle's Role:**  
The differential oracle is designed to detect discrepancies between expected and actual system states post-test executions. In this context, the alarms were triggered due to observed differences in the system state compared to the seed (initial) state.

**Evaluation Process:**  
The process involves examining `post_diff` logs and manually running diffs for the system states associated with each trial. This comprehensive approach aims to identify any deviations that might affect system reliability or functionality.

## Is the Alarm Justified?

**Correctness of Alarm:**  
Given that the differential oracle's purpose is to ensure the system can revert to its original state after tests, the alarm is justified in highlighting discrepancies. However, the operational status of the nodes indicates that while the state differences exist, they may not necessarily compromise the system's functionality.

**Considerations:**
- **System's Resilience:** Active nodes post-testing suggest the system's resilience, capable of continuing operations despite state differences.
- **Impact on Functionality:** The alarms indicate a need to investigate the nature of the state differences to assess their impact on system functionality and reliability.

## Recommendations

- **Review and Adjustment of Recovery Procedures:** Examine the recovery process to identify why the system failed to revert to the exact seed state and implement adjustments as necessary.
- **Detailed Analysis of State Differences:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the differences detected by the differential oracle to determine their significance and potential impact on the system.
- **Enhancement of Differential Oracle Logic:** Refine the oracle's logic to distinguish between critical state differences that affect functionality and non-critical discrepancies that do not impede operational capabilities.

## What happened

**Overview:**  
Alarms were triggered for two test cases due to a failed attempt at reverting the system back to its seed state, as indicated by differences in the system state. These alarms suggest potential discrepancies or anomalies following test executions.

**Challenge in Analysis:**  
For both instances, the logs that would typically provide insight into the nature of the state differences and potential reasons for the failure to recover to the seed state are not available. This lack of data complicates the analysis and understanding of each case's specifics.

## Analysis

Without access to the relevant logs, it's challenging to perform a detailed analysis to understand why the system could not revert to its initial state. The absence of logs also means that determining the impact of these discrepancies on the system's functionality or reliability is not straightforward.

## Expected Behavior

Ideally, the system should be able to revert to its seed state after test executions to ensure consistency and reliability. Additionally, logs should be accessible and available to provide necessary details for analysis whenever alarms are raised.

## What happened

**Alarm Overview:**  
An alarm was triggered for a test case due to a reported failure in reverting the system back to its seed state, indicating discrepancies in the system state. Notably, this alarm was raised under circumstances where no clusters were deployed, suggesting the issue may not be rooted in the system's configuration or operation.

**Contextual Insight:**  
This scenario underscores an infrastructure availability issue rather than a fault within the system's configuration or operational logic. The alarm, while true in detecting a failure to achieve the desired state, essentially signals the impact of external factorsâ€”specifically, the unavailability of critical infrastructure components.

## Analysis

The true nature of the alarm, juxtaposed with the lack of infrastructure availability. It illustrates that the system's ability to revert to a seed state, or perform any stateful operations, is contingent upon the availability and reliability of the underlying infrastructure.
