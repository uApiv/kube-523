## Breakdown
Splunk architectural design [claims](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/pdfs/tech-brief/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf) to operate on the pillars of availability, performance, scalability, security, and management. 

## 1. Availability
- `affinity`: Ensures pods are placed based on specific criteria, which can be crucial for availability in multi-node environments.
- `livenessProbe`: Helps in detecting unresponsive containers and restarting them to maintain availability.
- `readinessProbe`: Ensures traffic is only routed to ready containers, enhancing overall service availability.
- `startupProbe`: Ensures that the application is fully operational before marking it as ready, improving startup reliability.
- `replicas`: Influences the redundancy and availability of the application instances.
- `tolerations`: Allows pods to be scheduled on nodes with certain taints, improving resilience in diverse environments.
- `topologySpreadConstraints`: Ensures pods are spread across different topologies, enhancing fault tolerance and availability.

## 2. Performance
- `resources`: Allocating sufficient CPU and memory resources ensures the application can handle varying usage efficiently.

## 3. Scalability
- `replicas`: Directly impacts the scalability of the application by defining the number of pod instances.
- `resources`: Proper resource allocation is key to scaling the application based on workload demands.

## 4. Security
- `serviceAccount`: Determines the identity of the pod for accessing Kubernetes resources, which is crucial for enforcing security policies.
- `imagePullSecrets`: Used for secure access to private image repositories.
- `volumes`: Can include sensitive data and should be secured appropriately.

## 5. Management
- `image`: Central to version and configuration management of the containerized application.
- `imagePullPolicy`: Impacts how image updates are managed and rolled out.
- `schedulerName`: Allows specifying a custom scheduler, impacting how pods are managed and scheduled.
- `serviceTemplate`: Defines how services are created and managed, impacting overall service management.
- `monitoringConsoleRef`, `clusterManagerRef`, `clusterMasterRef`, `licenseManagerRef`, `licenseMasterRef`: References to external or internal management or monitoring components.


## Complexity Metric Analysis
Complexity can be evaluated by evaluating the depth and width of the operator CRD. We can utilize the metric for CRD complexity = average depth + average breadth. Where average depth is calculated by summing up the depth for each parent parameter and dividing the sum with the number of total parent parameters. Similarly, we can get a metric for average breadth by summing the width by the number of parameters at any given layer and then dividing by the number of total layers.
