# Alarm 1
trial_id: trial-00-0001/0003
## What happened
Acto deletes the apiVersion, but the system state dose not change.

Nothing happened in the state transition?

Actoâ€™s oracles raised an alarm because Acto expects the system state should have been changed.

## Categorization
False Alarm

## Root Cause
Acto delete the apiVersion, then the apiVersion is set to its default value. Therefore the operator don't change the system state. https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/blob/master/deploy/v2beta1/mpi-operator.yaml#L6705

## Expected behavior?
It would be hard for Acto to **understand** the meaning of each field. So no need to fix Acto.

# Alarm 2
trial_id: trial-00-0002/0003
## What happened
Acto deletes the items in downwardAPI. However, the system state is not changed.
## Categorization
Misoperation
## Root Cause
In trial-00-0002/mutated-003.yaml we can see that Acto delete the item of downwardAPI in the `ACTOKEY` field. Since the operator operates `Worker` and `Launcher`, the operator's behavior on `ACTOKEY` is **undefined** and in this case deleting the item of downwardAPI don't change the system state. And the mpi-operator should reject this desired state.
